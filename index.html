                <div>Erasmus+ is the EU's programme to support education, training, youth and sport in Europe.
                    It has an estimated budget of €26.2 billion. This is nearly double the funding compared to its predecessor programme (2014-2020).                  The 2021-2027 programme places a strong focus on social inclusion, the green and digital transitions, and promoting young people’s participation in democratic life.                    
                    It supports priorities and activities set out in the European Education Area, Digital Education Action Plan and the European Skills Agenda. The programme also
                    
                    supports the European Pillar of Social Rights
                    implements the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027

                <div class="sub_heading">How to take part</div>
                <div>This page contains a general overview of how to take part. You will need to check the specific action that you are interested in to see the criteria you should meet.
                    Erasmus+ is a very wide programme, covering a diverse range of actions.
                    
                    How you can take part depends broadly on two factors:
                    
                    if you are applying by yourself or on behalf of an organisation
                    in which country you or your organisation is based
                    Individual applicants
                    If you are looking to take part by yourself, it’s likely that you will need to apply through an organisation such as your university, training centre, company and so on.
                    
                    You can ask them if they are applying for a project grant, or explore the Erasmus+ app for advice and inspiration.
